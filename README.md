# Translator-Offline-Using-python
This project is part of my learning course of python language.
Please use test(input).txt file for test run or any other .txt file that you have

# Working
For me both the code and the .txt file along with the translation tool need to be present in the same folder.But it might be different for others.

# Download :

pip install translate
